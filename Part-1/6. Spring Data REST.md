### Spring Boot Applcation( JPA | H2 Database |Data REST Example)

Now if I want to fetch a student or if I want to add a new student what we need is a controller right 
So whenever you send a request, the request goes to the controller.

Now depend upon what type of request you are sending 
if you are sending a GET request below request handler method getting called.

```
@GetMapping("/student/{stdId}")
	public Optional<Student> getStudent(@PathVariable("stdId")int stdId) {
		return stdDao.findById(stdId);
	}
```
if you are sending a PUT request below request handler method getting called 

```
@PutMapping(path="/add",consumes = {"application/json"})
	public Student saveOrUpdateStudent(@RequestBody Student student) {
		stdRepo.save(student);
		return student;
	}
```
like this other methods also.

So what are the files we need,
We need a controller then we need repository where which you can perform the operation.


Normally when you work on spring MVC rest you need to create a controller and if you look at the controller it doesn't make any sense right because this controller 
simply accepting the request and performing the operation 


So I want to do the same thing but without a controller is it possible? And the answer is yes and that's where we have spring data rest.

For this, we create a new project.
