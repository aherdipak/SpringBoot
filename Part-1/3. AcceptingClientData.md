## Spring Boot (Accepting Client Data | getParameter() method)

What if I want to pass a data in request eg. `http: //localhost: 8080/home? name=Dipak` & I want to print that name on the home page.

What we use to do in servlet technology to get data from the request. We use to fetch data from the request object. 
Spring gives you the comfort of creating the object if you need, but in sevlet it was compulsory for us to refer both the object request object & response object even you don't need. In the spring you have a choice if you want to use it, go ahead and use it or not.

#### /HomeController.java
```
	@RequestMapping("/home")
	public String homePage(HttpServletRequest req) {
		
		HttpSession session = req.getSession();
		String name = req.getParameter("name");
		System.out.println("name : "+ name);
		session.setAttribute("name", name);
				
		/*
		 * 
		for passing this name to jsp page w have two choices here
		1. req.setAttribute("name", name); - and in jsp we can use getAttribute
		2. session.setAttribute("name", name); - we can use java code on jsp page and get session value or we can use JSTL/EL */
		
		return "home";
	}
```

#### /home.jsp
```
<%@ page language="java" contentType="text/html; charset=UTF-8" pageEncoding="UTF-8"%>
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<title>Insert title here</title>
</head>
<body>

Welcome in Spring Boot : ${name}
</body>
</html>
```
